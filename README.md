### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My Name is Judge-Paul Ogebe 
#### I live in Abuja, Nigeria and I am a Computer Science Student.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ReactJs and Javascript. I learnt the basics of Python because I wanted to use Django in my projects and started learning django but apparently it does not work perfectly with React and I also intend to use React. So I moved completely from Python and started my Javascript journey.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on My Portfolio Site It is going to be a one page multiple sections site and when it is complete I will upload it here
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Full Stack Web Projects but not at the moment I still have a lot to learn before I am ready
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/paulogebe) and if you have a job for me I am also available on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/judge-paul-ogebe-719370246)
